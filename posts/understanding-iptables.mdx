title: Understanding IPTables

description: "This rule set is designed for a Linux system that:

- Allows SSH (port 22) as the primary remote access method.
- Supports basic system functionality (loopback, established/related connections, ICMP).
- Optionally allows common services (web, mail, file sharing, database) while blocking everything else by default.
- Assumes a typical server use case but can be trimmed or expanded based on your needs.

You can remove or comment out rules for services you donâ€™t need.
